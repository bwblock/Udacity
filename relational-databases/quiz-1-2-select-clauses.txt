Quiz: Select Clauses
Here are the new select clauses introduced in the previous video:

... limit count
Return just the first count rows of the result table.

... limit count offset skip
Return count rows starting after the first skip rows.

... order by columns
... order by columns desc

Sort the rows using the columns (one or more, separated by commas) as the sort key. 
Numerical columns will be sorted in numerical order; string columns in alphabetical order. With desc, the order is reversed (desc-ending order).

... group by columns
Change the behavior of aggregations such as max, count, and sum. 
With group by, the aggregation will return one row for each distinct value in columns.
